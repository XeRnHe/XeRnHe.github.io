$\qquad$2. 规划行程。

## 范文

Dear Jim,

$\quad$Hope this letter finds you well. Hearing you are interested in the unique charm of Beijing, I'm more than willing to be your guide.

$\quad$To ensure that we can be fully immersed in both traditional and contemporary atmosphere of the city, I plan to show you around some famous landmarks and sites. We'll meet at 9 a.m. at the school gate and kick off our day with a visit to the Temple of Heaven, a true marvel of ancient Chinese architecture. Then we'll continue our ways up towards the lively CBD area for lunch and try some entertainments that are fancied by the young Beijingers. In the afternoon, we can explore hutongs which serve as a time machine —— wandering around them, we'll build a genuine connection to the bygone days and lifestyles of the old Beijing.

$\quad$If you have any questions or requests, please feel free to let me know. I can't wait to have this city adventure with you and I'm sure you'll have a great fun!
